                                                      recently in December, I came to Portugal, and now I have full

                                                      from the starting of my graduation, I had interest in computer 
                                                      programming for that purpose during my graduation period I learned 
                                                      some basic stuff about programming, C++ programming,Java programming 
                                                      and data structure. 

                                                      Where I lived in India, there was neither any good institute nor any job

                                                      when last week i was scrolling on the Internet, and I found your ad that you
